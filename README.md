#Modeling 3 dimensional temperature profile of Sun

Hello World :smiley:

In a nutshell what is this project about: Finding out the trajectory of a ray of light throuh the sin's atmosphere and based on it find the temperature profile of sun. Now this calculated temperature is not the actual temperature present there. What we calculate is the apparent temperature we see from a particular location and at a particular frequency.

To get started we will first dwell into the atmosphere of the sun and checkout what's hot there :wink:

The atmosphere of the sun is composed of several layers, mainly the photosphere, the chromosphere and the corona. It's in these outer layers that the sun's energy, which has bubbled up from the sun's interior layers, is detected as sunlight.

**Photosphere**

The lowest layer of the sun's atmosphere is the photosphere. It is about 300 miles (500 kilometers) thick. This layer is where the sun's energy is released as light. The photosphere is marked by bright, bubbling granules of plasma and darker, cooler sunspots, which emerge when the sun's magnetic field breaks through the surface.
The photosphere is also the source of solar flares: tongues of fire that extend hundreds of thousands of miles above the sun's surface. Solar flares produce bursts of X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, electromagnetic radiation and radio waves.

**Chromosphere**

The next layer is the chromosphere. The chromosphere emits a reddish glow as super-heated hydrogen burns off. But the red rim can only be seen during a total solar eclipse. At other times, light from the chromosphere is usually too weak to be seen against the brighter photosphere.

**Corona**

The third layer of the sun's atmosphere is the corona. It can only be seen during a total solar eclipse as well. It appears as white streamers or plumes of ionized gas that flow outward into space. Temperatures in the sun's corona can get as high as 3.5 million degrees F (2 million degrees C). As the gases cool, they become the solar wind.
