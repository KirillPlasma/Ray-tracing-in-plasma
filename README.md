#Modeling 3 dimensional temperature profile of Sun

Hello World :smile:

In a nutshell what is this project about: Finding out the trajectory of a ray of light throuh the sin's atmosphere and based on it find the temperature profile of sun. Now this calculated temperature is not the actual temperature present there. What we calculate is the apparent temperature we see from a particular location and at a particular frequency.

To get started we will first dwell into the atmosphere of the sun and checkout what's hot there :wink:
